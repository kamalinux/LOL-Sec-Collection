**Computer Security**

Description : *Understanding and improving the behavior of computing systems in the presence of adversaries*

Computer Systems <-> Adversaries <-> Security Engineers

**Computer Systems**

 - Operating Systems
 - Networks , Internet
 - Web Browsers , Web Applications
 - Software Applications
 - Smart Phones
 - Cars : Engine Control Systems , Break
 - Traffic Light ( Industrial Control Systems )
 - etc ...

**Security Goals**

 - Confidentiality - don't leak private information
 - Integrity - no un authorized modification of information
 - Authenticity - identified and accurate priciples
 - Availability - services operating when needed

**Adversaries**

 - hax0rs ( Script Kiddies )
 - Political dissidents , Insiders
 - Hacktivists
 - Professional criminals
 - National goverments

**Targeting Attack Example**

 - Phase 01 : SQL Injection Attack to obtain user credentials ( Web Security )
 - Phase 02 : Password Cracking to decrypt user credentials hashes ( Cryptography )
 - Phase 03 : Privilege Escalation to upgrade user access ( Low-Level Software Security )
 - Phase 04 : Spraying with sensitive credentials ( Post Exploitation )
 - Phase 05 : Social Engineering in compromised network ( on your own )

**Threat Models**

 - Asset   : information or resource of value
 - Threat : mechanism used by an adversary to gain unauthorized access to an access
 - Vulnerability : flaw or detect in a computer system
 - Atack : occurs when an adversary attempts to exploit a vulnerability
 - Compromise - occurs when an attack is successful and adversaryhas access or control over a resource
 - Threat Model : collection of threats for a particular environment known attacks and adversaries

**Security Models**

 - Trust Model : all participants & computer systems that are assumed to be uncompromised and behave as expected
 - Security Model : countermeasures & mechanisms to improve security

**CS642 Goals**

 - Understand threats and attacks
 - Security evaluation
 - Defensive technologies
 - Advance our technical skills ( x86 assembly, cryptography, web security, networking  )
 
 **Ethics** 

 - Think like bad boys
 - Act like good guys
 - Learn how systems break
 - Security is an arms race between attackers & defenders

**Legal Guidelines for Learning**

 - Using Computer Systems that we own
 - With ethical disclosure

**Disclosure**

 - Full disclosure : revealing everything known about a vulnerability
 - Responsible disclosure : ensuring vendors and have time to deploy countermeasures ( eg. patch ) before public disclosure
