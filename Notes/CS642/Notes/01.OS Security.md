## OS Security
Original Lecture Slide [ [PDF](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ace/media/lectures/os.pdf) ]

**Principles of Secure Designs**

 - Compartmentalization : *isolation, least privilege*
 - Defense-in-Depth : *use more than one security mechanism, secure the weakest , fail securely*
 - Keep it Simple : *economy of mechanism, psychological acceptability, good defaults*
 - Open Design

**Unix Family Tree**

| Year | OS Name | Developed by |
|--|--|--|
| 1960 | [Multics](https://multicians.org/history.html) | MIT, AT&T, Bell Labs,General Electric
| 1970 | [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) | Bell Labs, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie |
| 1991 | [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) | Linux Torvalds |
| 1993 | [freebsd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) | Nate Williams, Rod Grimes and Jordan Hubbard |
| Presense | [many others](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-UNIX#more-unix-like-operating-systems) | Various Vendors |

**Protection Mechanisms**

 - Low-level protection mechanisms
 - High level protection mechanisms
 - Programming Specific 

References [1](https://wiki.osdev.org/Security) , [2](https://en.bmstu.wiki/Protection_ring_%28Operating_Systems%29)

**Low-level Protection Rings**

 - Ring 0 : *kernel mode or supervisor mode*
 - Ring 1 : *equipment maintainence programs, drivers, programs that work with I/O*
 - Ring 2 : *database management system, the expansion of the OS*
 - Ring 3 : *applications, user mode*
 
 
( Note * Lower number = Higher privilege )

**High-level protection mechanisms**
 - *can be accomplished by many different ways*
 - file systems : *controls which users can read, write, execute or delete a file*

**Programming Specific protection mechanisms**

 - gcc : *smash the stack protector for C programming*
 - garbage collector : *when an object is no longer referenced , gc removes it and reclaims unused memory in interpreter languages such as Java, php ,etc ...*

**Memory isolation**

 - virtual memory
 - program and data stored in segments
 - descriptor control field : *read , write & execute*
 - segments are access controlled

 **Memory Protections**
 
 List from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection)
 - Segmentation
 - Paged virtual memory
 - Protection keys
 - Simulated segmentation
 - Capability-based addressing
 - Dynamic tainting

**Segmentation**

 - *dividing computer's memory into segments*
 - *a reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment*
 - *x86's multiple segmentaton feautures which are helpful for using protected memory*

**Paged Virtual Memory**

 - pages : *memory address space is divided into equal-sized blocks called pages*
 - *each page can reside in any location of the computer's physical memory, or be flagged as being protected*
 - *pages are basic of memory protection*
 - page table : *maps virtual memory to physical memory and usually invisible to process*
 - *unallocated pages, and pages allocated to any other application, do not have any addresses from the application point of view*

**Protection Keys**

 - memory protection key : *divides physical memory into blocks of a particular size (e.g., 4 KiB), each of which has an associated numerical value called a protection key*
 - *each process also has a protection key value associated with it*
 - *on a memory access, the hardware checks that the current process's protection key matches the value associated with the memory block being accessed; if not, an exception occurs*
 - *the protection bits supplied to system calls like mmap() and mprotect() allow a process to say whether any given page should be readable, writable, or executable*

**Password Storage**

 - most operating systems stored passwords as hash
 - using cryptographic algorithms such as md5 , sha256 , ntlm , etc ...
 - password protection for modern OS [ [Link](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/1103-alexander.pdf) ]

for Linux

 - /etc/passwd : *text file with one record per line , each describing user account and seperated with full column*
 - passwd file structure: `username:password:user_id:group_id:user_info:home_directory:command_shell` ( Eg. `smithj:x:561:561:Joe Smith:/home/smithj:/bin/bash` )
 - /etc/shadow : *stores actual password in encrypted format (more like the hash of the password) for user’s account*
 - shadow file structure : `username:encrypted_password[id$salted$hash]:last_password_changed:min_day_for_next_pass_change:max_day_for_pass_is_valid:warning_day_for_pass_expire:inactive_days_after_pass_expired:account_disabled_date` ( Eg . `john:$6$iTEFbMTM$CXmxPwErbEef9RUBvf1zv8EgXQdaZg2eOd5uXyvt4sFzi6G4lIqavLilTQgniAHm3Czw/LoaGzoFzaMm.YwOl/:17707:0:90:14:::` )
 - /etc/shadow permission : *root is owner for shadow file & other users are not allowed to read the file directly, to prevent them from gathering hashes passwords of others*

for Windows 

[Security Account Manager (SAM) file on Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager) , [dump windows password hashes](http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2011/12/dump-windows-password-hashes.html) , [SAM at microsoft's docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748%28v=ws.10%29)

**Reference monitor**

 - reference validation mechanism : *an access control policy over subjects' (e.g., processes and users) ability to perform operations (e.g., read and write) on objects (e.g., files and sockets) on a system*
 - kernel security : *monitors all data access & enforces security policy*

Example 1 - reference monitor concept

[ p1 top secret ] ---*send to P2*--> [ Reference Monitor ]    :no_entry_sign:  [ p2 secret ]

**Access Control**

1.Access Control Matrix
 - *the protection state of a computer system can be abstracted as a set of objects O , that is the set of entities that needs to be protected (e.g. processes, files, memory pages) and a set of subjects S , that consists of all active entities (e.g. users, processes)*

Demo

|  | a | b | c | d | e |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *user1* | r,w | - | r,w,own | - | r |
| *root* | r,w,x | r,w,x | r,w,x | r,w,x | r,w,x |
| *test* | r | r | - | - | r |
| *lol* | - | r,w | - | r,w,own | - |

where , 
 1. a,b,c,d,e = files ( Objects ) **bold**
 2. user1,root,test,lol = users ( Subjects ) *Italic*
 3. r,w,own = permitted operations 

2.Access Control List

 - list of permissions attached to an object ( eg. files )
 - implementations : file system ACL , networking ACL , SQL implementations

Demo ACL

**a** ( object file ) has following following access control

| users ( subject ) | operations ( permitted )  |
|-------|-------|
| user1 | r,w   |
| root  | r,w,x |
| test  | r     |

Examples
 - [nsfv4 ACL - freebsd](https://wiki.freebsd.org/NFSv4_ACLs)
 - [microsift ACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb457115%28v=technet.10%29)
 
3.Role Based Access Control
 - role : *set of users*
 - RBAC : *an approach to restricting system access to authorized users*
 - advantages : *many users, few roles & groups are more stable*

Conventions for role
-   S = Subject = A person or automated agent
-   R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level
-   P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource
-   SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P
-   SA = Subject Assignment
-   PA = Permission Assignment
-   RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
    -   A subject can have multiple roles.
    -   A role can have multiple subjects.
    -   A role can have many permissions.
    -   A permission can be assigned to many roles.
    -   An operation can be assigned to many permissions.
    -   A permission can be assigned to many operations

Demo

|:boy: users| :skull: roles | :open_file_folder: resources |
|--|--|--|
| user1 | engineering | server1 |
| user2 | marketing | server2 |
| user3 | human resources | server3 |

**Linux Access Control**

 Viewing file permission
 - can use online linux container [ [Test](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it) ]


Result

    root@tryit-relevant:~# ls -l
    
    total 4
    
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 Dec 8 21:26 myfile.txt

Permission for myfile.txt

 - linux : *role based access control*
 - role = *group*
 - individual (or process) = *user id ( id )*
 -  special user id -> 0
    -  *root user*
    - *permitted to do everything*
    - for files : *read, write, execute, create, delete, change permission, change owner, etc ...*
 
`-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 Dec 8 21:26 myfile.txt`
 - `-{}-{}-{}-`    :pencil:    -{ owner }-{ group }-{ others }-
 - `rwx`  :pencil: read, write ,execute permissions
 - `root root` ->  file assigned user and group

user roles

    staff:*:29:ace,sscott,kpat,rist
    web:*:31:ace,kpat,rist
    dev:*:32:ace,sscott,pbriggs

questions

 - Can sscott read the file README.md?
 - Can ace write to setup.cfg?
 - Which users can append to deploy.log?

**Process Ids**

ruid, euid, suid  :link: [ :parking:-Process ]  :link: rgid, egid, sgid

 - ruid : *real user id*
 - euid : *effective user id*
 - suid : *saved user id*
 - rgid : *real group id*
 - egid : *effective group id*
 - sgid : *saved group id*
 - fork / exec : 
        - *new process inherit all three ids*
        - ( *execpt for setid bit* )
 - seteuid ( newid ) system call : 
	- *changes euid*
	 - *can only change to saved uid or real uid*
	 - *unless euid == 0 in which case can set any id*
	 - *also seteguid()*
 - setid :pencil: [ --S --S --- t ]
	 - setuid : *on execute, set euid of new process to file owner's uid*
	 - setgid : *on execute, set egid of new process to file owner's gid*
	 - sticky bit ( for directories ) : *when set, restricts deletion and renaming of files*

`Notes` * **setuid/gid** : Permits necessary privilege escalation

Exercises

    [ace:/usr/bin/]: ls -l
    ...
    -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47032 Feb 17  2014 passwd
    ...
    -rwxr-sr-x 1 root  tty 19024 Feb 12  2015 wall

questions
 - When passwd is started: what are the RUID, EUID, and SUID 
values? 
- When wall is started: what are the RUID, EUID, and SUID? 
- What are the RGID, EGID, and SGID?

**Vulnerabilities**

file permission
`-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 5090 Jan 16  2015 tmp-read`

code

    ... 
    if (access("/tmp/myfile", R_OK) != 0) { 
     exit(-1); 
    }
    file = open("/tmp/myfile", "r");
    read(file, buf, 1024);
    close(file);
    printf("%s\n", buf);

Question
> Where is the vulnerability?

- `access("/tmp/myfile", R_OK)` -> :heavy_check_mark: */tmp/myfile has* read access
- `ln -sF /home/root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/myfile` -> :bust_in_silhouette: *attacker linking ssh private key file & permitted to read file*
- `open("/tmp/myfile", "r");` -> *program open /tmp/myfile*
- `read(file, buf, 1024);` -> *read from file and place it to buf*
- `close(file);` -> *close the file*
- `printf("%s\n", buf);` -> *show strings in buf* 
- race condition between attacker and tmp-read : *print root user's ssh private key*

Vulnerability called: time-of-check to time-of-use ( TOCTTOU )

**Better**

code

    euid = geteuid(); 
    ruid = getuid(); 
    seteuid(ruid);      
    file = open("/tmp/myfile", "r"); 
    read(file, buf, 1024); 
    close(file); 
    print("%s\n", buf);

 - `seteuid(ruid);` -> drop privileges for user
 - `ln -sF /home/root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/myfile` -> attacker linking two files
 - `file = open("/tmp/myfile", "r");` -> permission denied to open file

> Qes : What security design principle?

> Ans : Least privilege

setid

 - permits necessary privilege escalation
 - source of many privilege escalation vulnerabilities
	 - race conditions ( tocttou )
	 - control-flow hijacking
